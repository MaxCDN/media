MaxCDN Media (Logos and Artwork)
=====

MaxCDN loves third party developers and brand advocates. We want to help make your project/site(s) awesome, and often that includes showing off MaxCDN integration with an image. In order to keep everyone happy (and avoid involving lawyers), we've created this repository and filled it with artwork that you may use in your own applications/site(s).

If you want to use artwork not included in this repository, please email <marketing@maxcdn.com> and we'll talk.


## These things are awesome and you should do them:

* Use the logo(s) to link to MaxCDN

* Use the logo(s) to advertise that your product has built-in MaxCDN integration

* Use the logo's in a blog post or news article about MaxCDN


## Please don't do these things:

* Use the ANY logos for your application(s)/site(s) icon/favicon

* Create a modified version of ANY of the logos 

* Integrate ANY of the logos into your logo

* Use ANY artwork without permission

* Sell ANY artwork without permission

## Naming your application

Please avoid naming your projects anything that implies MaxCDN's endorsement.
